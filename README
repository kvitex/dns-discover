Make discover of hosts by DNS for prometheus black-box-exporter.
Script acts like Prometheus exporter and using Flask framework.
It discovers nameservers from required domains, makes XFER request from discovered nameservers.
All A records are to be placed into dns_blackbox_icmp_<your_domain>.json files.
Script returns to Prometheus some metrics and checks if domain serial is equal for all nameservers.
Host running script  should be allowed to make XFER from NS servers for requied domains.
To start script use "start_ap.sh"

Here is a sample configuration for Prometheus:

- job_name: 'dns-discover'
    scrape_interval: 5m
    metrics_path: /metrics
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - my.domain.com
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: __param_domain_name
      - source_labels: [__param_domain_name]
        target_label: instance
      - target_label: __address__
        replacement: localhost:9053
